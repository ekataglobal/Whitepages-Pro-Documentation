# Identity Check API

Overview

Verify customer identities, screen applications for fraud, and assess the risk of a transaction. Whitepages Pro Identity Check is the only 5-query-in-1 identity verification solution on the market. In addition to providing rich data about each input, Identity Check performs the following cross-verifications:

1. email-to-name
2. phone-to-name
3. phone-to-address
4. address-to-name
5. IP geolocation-to-address
6. IP geolocation-to-phone


## Request
The Identity Check API can field up to two sets of inputs. You should submit specific parameters based on the amount of data you want to validate.
If you have one set of inputs:

* primary.name
* primary.phone
* primary.address.street_line_1
* primary.address.street_line_2 (optional, can include this as part of street_line_1)
* primary.address.city
* primary.address.state_code
* primary.address.postal_code
* primary.address.country_code
* email_address
* ip_address
* api_key (required)

A well-formatted request with one set of inputs looks like:

```

## Response

An Identity Check response consists of various checks based on the inputs entered. All possible components are below:


**Phone Checks**

Includes primary_phone_checks, and secondary_phone_checks. These components indicate whether the phone is valid, provides metadata attributes, and veri es if the phone subscriber name matches the input name provided and if the phone location matches the input address provided.

Inputs considered:
primary.phone, primary.address, and primary.name secondary.phone, secondary.address, and secondary.name


| Field     | Type | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| error | Object | Object contains 2 strings. message and name. Possible values: {"message": "Could not retrieve entire response", "name": "PartialError"} and {"message": "_Phone number_ is international. You have international phone checks disabled for your API key.", "name": "InternationalPhoneDisabled"} |
| warnings | Array | A warning message that returns "Invalid Input", "Invalid county_hint value. Only Alpha-2 and Alpha-3 supported" or empty array. |
| is_valid | Boolean | A boolean value indicating if the phone is a valid phone number and has been assigned to a carrier. Possible values are true, false or null. |
| phone_to_name | String | Verification result whether the subscriber name for the phone matches the input name. Possible values: Match, No match, No name found, null. A match is a positive indicator and should allow clearing the transactions when used in conjunction with other signals. A no match is a modest risk indicator. Additional testing needed for specific customer scenario to assign appropriate weighting. |
| phone_to_address | String | Verification result whether the address associated with the phone matches the input address. Possible values: Match, Postal match, Zip+4 match, City/State match, No match, null. A match are positive indicators and should allow clearing the transactions when used in conjunction with other signals. A no match is a modest risk indicator, but also can be result of family plans or phones belonging to a business. |
| subscriber_name | String | Subscriber name of the input phone. |
| subscriber_age_range | String | Subscriber’s age in a 5 year range, possible values: 18-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85-89, 90+. |
| country_code | String | Country code for the input phone. |
| is_commercial | Boolean | Indicates if the phone is registered to a business. Possible values are true, false, or null. |
| line_type | String | Line type for the input phone. Possible values: Mobile, Landline, Fixed VOIP, Non-fixed VOIP, Premium, Tollfree, Voicemail, Other, Unknown. Mobile, Fixed VOIP (E.g. Comcast or other cable provider of phone where phone number is fixed to a physical address) are positive indicators and should allow clearing the transaction when used in conjunction with other signals. Non-Fixed VOIP, Tollfree number is a risk indicator and the transaction should be flagged for further review |
| carrier | String | The company that provides voice and/or data services for this phone number. Carriers are returned at the MVNO level. Certain carriers correlate well as a potential risk signal. Please contact us APISupport@whitepages.com to learn more. |
| is_prepaid | Boolean | Indicates if the phone is associated with a prepaid account. Possible values are True, False, or null. Depending on your business, prepaid phones can be a strong risk indicator (i.e. selling luxury goods). Some businesses, like prepaid credit card providers, would view a prepaid phone as a positive signal that the transaction is not fraudulent. |

The greater the number of days, the better the signal of the transaction being good when used in conjunction with other signals. Typical buckets during risk analysis are: New (< 90 days), Established (Between 90 and 720 days), Well Established (Over 720 days). New bucket is a potential risk indicator and the transaction should be flagged for further review |

| email_domain_creation_days | Integer | Days since when the email domain was created. The greater the number of days, the better the signal of the transaction being good when used in conjunction with other signals. Typically an email where the domain has been created less than 30 days ago is a risk indicator and the transaction should be flagged for further review |

**Identity Check Con dence Score**

The check name here is identity_check_score. The Con dence Score provides a comprehensive assessment of a transaction by leveraging the millions of transactional patterns across our network and the power of Identity Check’s 70+ data elements in a single, actionable score—made possible by sophisticated data analysis and machine learning models. The core strength of the score is that it re ects real life transaction outcomes based on the feedback information we get from our customers. We also see signals across our network and calculate multiple proprietary inputs such as identity element velocities, transactional frequencies, and linkage histories.

To return a score, we need at least two inputs from the following:
Name (primary or secondary) 
Phone (primary or secondary) 
Address (primary or secondary) 
Email address or IP address

| Field     | Type | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| identity_check_score | Integer | The score ranges from 0 to 500. In general, a higher number score indicates a riskier transaction, while a lower number indicates a good transaction. |


A sample response:

```json
{
  "identity_check_score": 149
}
